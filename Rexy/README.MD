## Preamble


**Rexy** (rec-sy) is an open-source recommendation system based on a general User-Product-Tag schema and a flexible structure that has been designed to be adaptable with any kind of data schema.

Rexy is a kind of a wild beast and may doesn't seem friendly at first sight. But don't worry you can simply bring him around by using [UPeT](https://github.com/kasramvd/UPeT) ;).
