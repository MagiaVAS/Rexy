**Rexy** (rec-sy) is an open-source recommendation system based on a general User-Product-Tag schema and a flexible structure that has been designed to be adaptable with any kind of data schema.

Rexy is kind of a wild beast and may doesn't seem so friendly at the first sight. But don't worry! you can easily bring him around using [UPeT](https://github.com/kasramvd/UPeT).
